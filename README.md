Better History
=================

Chrome is an excellent browser. However browsing your history kinda stinks. Let's make it better friend.

Stack
----------------

* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) for javascript
* [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) for specs
* [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) for templating
* [Chrome bootstrap](https://github.com/roykolak/chrome-bootstrap) for styles
* [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) for development

Setup
-----------------

Better History uses Node.js for development setup, compiling, and running specs. You'll need to run the command below to install the the dev environment.

    $ npm install

To generate coffeescript, templates, and package files when changed locally, run the following.
