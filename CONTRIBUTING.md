Contributing
======================

Want to help out? Awesome! Couple of things

* Include specs for code changes (Backbone views excluded)
* The [80 column rule](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width) is helpful to keep line complexity low `:set cc=80`
* Kill all the whitespace
* Never use `this`, always use `@`
* Commit messages should follow [this](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* Before starting a new feature, open an issue and let's talk
